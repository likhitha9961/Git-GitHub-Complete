🧠 What is Git?
Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS).

✅ Version Control System (VCS):

Tracks changes to files over time.

Allows you to go back to previous versions if needed.

Keeps a full history of who made changes and when.

✅ Distributed:

Every developer has the entire project history on their own machine.

Unlike centralized systems (like SVN), Git doesn’t depend on a single server.

🎨 Real-Life Analogy:
Imagine writing a school project:

Without Git: You save files like project_v1.docx, project_v2_final.docx, and so on. It’s confusing and you might overwrite files.

With Git: You take snapshots (commits) of your project at different stages, and you can restore or compare any version.

✅ Git prevents “Oops, I lost my work” moments.

🔥 Why Use Git?
✅ Track your project history (like a time machine 🕰️).
✅ Collaborate with teammates on the same project without overwriting each other’s work.
✅ Open-source and free.
✅ Works offline and is extremely fast.

🛠 Setting Up Git
Git is a tool/software that runs on your system.

On Windows, install Git Bash.

On Mac, use the built-in Terminal.

On Linux, install via package manager:
sudo apt install git

✅ Step 1: Verify Installation
Check if Git is installed:
git --version

✅ Example Output:
git version 2.50.0.windows.1

🎨 Why this command?
It ensures Git is installed correctly and shows the version.

✅ Step 2: Configure Git
When you make changes, Git needs to know who you are.
This information is added to every commit you make.

🔥 Global Configuration:
git config --global user.name "Likhitha"
git config --global user.email "likhitha@example.com"

✅ --global means:
Applies this configuration to all repositories on your system.

🎨 Real-Life Analogy:
This is like writing your name and email on all your submitted assignments.

🔥 Local Configuration:
If you want different settings for a specific project:
git config user.name "Another Name"
git config user.email "another@example.com"

✅ Only applies to the current repository.

🔥 Check Configuration:
git config --list

✅ Shows all your Git settings:
user.name=Likhitha
user.email=likhitha@example.com
core.editor=vim

🪄 Essential Git Commands

🔥 1️⃣ git init
git init
✅ Initializes a Git repository in your folder.

🎨 Scenario:
You create a folder my-project → Run git init → Now Git will track all changes in this folder.

🔥 2️⃣ git status
git status

✅ Shows:

Which files are untracked.

Which files are modified.

Which files are staged for commit.

🎨 Example Output:
Untracked files:
  index.html

  🔥 3️⃣ git config --global credential.helper store
✅ Saves your GitHub username and password so you don’t need to enter them every time you push changes.

Working Directory → Staging Area → Local Repository → Remote Repository

🎨 Analogy:

📝 Working Directory: You write your assignment.

📥 Staging Area: You keep it in a folder marked "Ready to Submit".

📚 Local Repository: You submit and save it in your college archive.

🌐 Remote Repository: Your teacher uploads it to the university portal.
